**This repository contains a simple example of an XOR-encoded payload execution in C. The code demonstrates how to decode an XOR-encoded payload and execute it in memory. This project showcases my understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and basic encryption techniques.
**
Project Files:

main.c: The main C file containing the XOR decoding and payload execution logic.

**Features:**

XOR decoding of an encoded payload.
Memory allocation for the decoded payload.
Execution of the decoded payload using a new thread.

**How to Use**

**Prerequisites:**

Basic understanding of C programming, Windows API, and memory management.
A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio).

**Instructions:**

Step 1: Replace /* Encoded payload here */ in encoded_payload with your actual encoded payload data.

Step 2: Save the code to a file named main.c.

Step 3: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing main.c.

Step 4: Compile the code using a C compiler:
"gcc -o xor_payload main.c"

or if you are using Visual Studio, create a new project, add main.c to the project, and compile it.

Step 5: Run the compiled executable:
"./xor_payload"

**Expected Outcome:**

The program will decode the XOR-encoded payload and execute it in memory. Make sure to replace the placeholder encoded payload with a valid payload to see the execution.
Additional Information
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of C programming, Windows API, and memory management.
How to Run: Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio), and execute the resulting binary on a Windows machine.
